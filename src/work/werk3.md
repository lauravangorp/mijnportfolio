MORE ABOUT COMPANIONSHIP IN THE AGE OF LONELINESS

KAWS is one of the most prominent and prolific artists of his generation.

Working across art, fashion and design, he creates colour-filled paintings, murals, large-scale sculptures, street and public art, products, and streetwear. His work is infused with humour and humanity and is deeply tied to our times. KAWS draws his cast of characters from pop-culture animations to form a distinctive artistic vocabulary.  

Featuring a new text by Margaret Atwood (The Handmaidâ€™s Tale), a biographical essay by NGV Senior Curator of Contemporary Art, Dr Simon Maidment, and more than 200 images, including documentation of the career-survey exhibition KAWS: Companionship in the Age of Loneliness at the National Gallery of Victoria, this publication is a comprehensive overview of the artist's work to date.
