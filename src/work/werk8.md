Daniel Arsham recently unveiled his Porsche 930A Turbo collaboration, with the artist having completely overhauled a 1986 930 Turbo donor car to build a road-ready white sportscar that took two years to make with the German car manufacturer. This time around, the artist announces the release of a limited ERODED 911 TURBO sculptural edition. Inspired by the iconic 1986 911 Turbo (930), the collectible features an eroded version of the coveted Porsche vehicle and an extension of Arsham’s ongoing Future Relic series.

<br>“This edition reimagines the iconic 1986 911 Turbo (930) as a calcified relic from the future. Geological materials and German engineering come together to blend the past, present, and future into one work of art,” said Arsham on Instagram.

<br>Each edition measures 12.2 inches in length and weighs just under seven pounds. The ERODED 911 TURBO will arrive in an Arsham studio designed packaging with die-cut foam, sealing label and a pair of white art handling gloves. The edition is limited to 500 pieces and each piece includes an Arsham Editions holographic label verifying its edition number and authenticity.
