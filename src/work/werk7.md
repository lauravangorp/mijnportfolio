Rage, the Flower Thrower or Love is in the Air is one of the most iconic stencils by Banksy. It shows a masked Palestinian throwing a bouquet of flowers.

Banksy is known for displaying his works out in the open for the public to view it, in places such as walls in the case of Rage, the Flower Thrower. Still, the majority of his public paintings are often resold, even if it means removing the wall they were painted on.

<h3>What does the work show?</h3>

The drawing first appeared on a wall on the side of a garage on the highway from Beit Sahour opposite Citroen/Peugeot car dealership in Jerusalem. The man in the painting is wearing a scarf and a baseball cap and appears to aim the flowers at someone(s) in rage.

The man and the flower wrapping are made in black and white. The flowers and the stem protruding from the wrapper are done in color. The portrait is reminiscent of the images from the street and campus riots of the 1960s. The anger and frustration can be seen in the posture of the man as he tries to bomb the establishment with flowers.

In 2005 a gay parade was staged in the city of Jerusalem, but the participants were ambushed by protestors who stabbed three and injured many scores of others. According to many commentators, the black and white man in the image represented as a protestor or rioter. His gears are typically associated with violence. There are a bandana and a cap worn backward to conceal the identity, while the flowers are in color, vivid, multi-color, which could be interpreted as a metaphorical of the gay pride flag. The flowers themselves in the mages signify hope for peaceful resolution of conflicts.

<h3>The location</h3>

Banksy painted the work on the 760 kilometers wall that separates Israel from Palestine, which the artist said: essentially turns Palestine into the world’s largest open prison.

In his book Wall & Piece (War and Spray) in 2005, while he was painting the wall with this mural, one of the residents told him: We do not want this wall to be beautiful, we do not want this wall, go home.

<h3> The meaning </h3>
The facial expression and the posture of the man in the mural tellingly suggest that there is a violent intent. However, by substituting a rock, or a Molotov cocktail or a bomb with a bouquet, Banksy is advocating for peace instead of violence. The location itself is prominent to the message behind the image.

Many associated this mural to those events, but it can also be said to be inspired by the violent unrest in the Middle East. However, Banksy is a known pacifist and anti-war; several events could have influenced the mural.

The bouquet in this image symbolizes, in addition to peace, life, and love may also be associated with the commemoration of lost lives during the old era religious conflict. The piece is an excellent example of Banksy’s use of art to convey messages of social significance.

Rage, the Flower Thrower is one of the most important and sought-after works of art by Banksy. Since its production, it has been reproduced on phone covers, posters, t-shirts, as well as many other types of merchandise. The image is also the one on the cover of Banksy iconic bool “Wall and Piece” produced in 2005.

Rage, the Flower Thrower is a powerful piece that conveys important messages to the public through the use of graffiti. The simplicity of the image also makes the work effective as it relays the point straight away. Banksy’s bold use of black and white indicates his visual skills, which draws the attention of the viewers right away. The artist has been quoted in some articles saying how he started using stencils art. According to the artist, stencil art was a faster way for him to do his work after having some close calls during his early career days, with authorities nearly catching him.

Just like many of his other works, Rage, the Flower Thrower, also draws inspiration from political and social situations and always wants the public to be aware of what is happening, as some occurrences might pass over the general public. Banksy uses these circumstances to not only make himself known but also to get his pieces of work out there and educate the public about what is happening around the world.

<h3> Other versions </h3>
Banksy has created several versions of the mural on canvas, and was even released on the red background with a version of 150 Rage, the Flower Thrower (Love is in the Air) signed prints as well as 500 unsigned prints. It is believed that the floral replacement in the image was inspired by the poem “Wage Peace” by Judyth Hill.

<h3> Conclusion </h3>

By the message relayed by this piece as well as the other events that can be linked to it, Banksy created an essential portrait. He has effectively united all kinds of people with different opinions due to the different ways to interpret this artwork. Banksy has done so, however, in a more controversial way than usual. Many do not agree with pacifism and its location in Jerusalem, where there are a high military and gun presence.

Nevertheless, this piece forces the viewers to consider why they would potentially want to hurl something harmful towards a group of other human beings if they could, instead, toss something useful their way. It makes everyone who sees it to consider the consequences of destructive actions by swapping this thought with what could happen if constructive action was taken instead. Rage, the Flower Thrower reframes the approach to dealing with evil, postulating that the way out can sometimes come from good.
